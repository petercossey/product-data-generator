## Validation Rules

### 1. Price Rules
- All prices must round to nearest 0.05
- Sale Price must be 10-25% less than Price
- Price ranges:
  - 40% products: $10.00-$50.00
  - 40% products: $51.00-$200.00
  - 20% products: $201.00-$500.00

### 2. Inventory Rules
- 90% products: Track Inventory="Y", Stock Level=0-1000
- 10% products: Track Inventory="N", Stock Level=null
- Even distribution across categories (Â±10%)

### 3. Brand Distribution
- Each brand should represent ~20% of products

### 4. URL Formation
- Pattern: /products/{product-name-slugified}-{sku}
- All lowercase, hyphens for spaces
- Remove special characters

### 5. Category Assignment
- Most products (approximately 80%) should have a single category
- Multiple categories are allowed where logically appropriate (approximately 20% of products)
- When using multiple categories, separate them with semicolons (;)
- Example: "Automotive/Storage/Roof Trays/Roof Boxes;Automotive/Storage/Spares, Brackets & Components/Brackets"
- Common scenarios for multiple categories:
  - Universal fit components that work across multiple product lines
  - Spare parts that belong in both their primary category and "Spares, Brackets & Components"
  - Accessories that are compatible with multiple product lines
  - Cross-compatible mounting systems
- Never force multiple categories if it doesn't make logical sense for the product
